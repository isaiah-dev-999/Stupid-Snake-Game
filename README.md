No problem! I’ll add a section at the top to indicate that it’s a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Here’s the updated README:

# Snake Game 🐍 (Work in Progress)

> **Note**: This project is a work in progress. Some features are still being developed, and the game is actively being improved.

A classic Snake game built in Python with Pygame, featuring multiple modes, power-ups, and debugging options. This project is perfect for coding enthusiasts and gamers looking to enjoy or expand upon a well-known game.

## Features
- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Maneuver the snake to eat food, grow longer, and try to beat your high score.
- **Endless Mode**: Play infinitely! Collisions reduce the snake’s length rather than ending the game, making it a survival challenge.
- **Debugging Mode**: Track essential game data such as the snake's coordinates, food position, and reverse-control state, making it ideal for testing and fine-tuning.
- **Reverse Control Power-Up**: Randomly appearing items that temporarily reverse controls, adding an exciting twist to the gameplay.

## Game Modes
1. **Normal Mode**: Traditional snake gameplay where the game ends upon hitting the screen boundary or colliding with the snake itself.
2. **Endless Mode**: Keeps the game going indefinitely. In this mode, colliding with walls or the snake’s body reduces the snake’s length, allowing for a continuous experience.
3. **Debug Mode**: 
   - Available in both Normal and Endless modes, Debug Mode shows on-screen information for easier testing and optimization.
   - Displays data like the snake’s current position, the location of food, and if any control reversals are active.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
   cd snake-game
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. Install Pygame with:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage

To run the game, use:
```bash
python main_game.py
```

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D**: Move the snake up, left, down, and right respectively.
- **Escape**: Exits to the main menu when in Endless Mode, allowing you to select another game mode.

## Future Ideas
Below are some additional features that could further enhance the gameplay:
- **Speed Power-Ups**: Temporarily increase or decrease the snake’s speed.
- **Maze Walls**: Add obstacles to create mazes and additional challenges.
- **Leaderboard**: Record and display top scores in each mode for a competitive edge.
- **Power-Up Variety**: Additional power-ups like invincibility, temporary slow-downs, or food multipliers.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the project, make your changes, and submit a pull request. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

This README should clearly indicate that the game is under active development. Let me know if you’d like any more adjustments!
